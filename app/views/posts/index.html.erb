  <div class="post-title">What is Lindy Hop?</div>
  <div class="post-body">
    Lindy Hop is the original Swing Dance, developed in Harlem in the 1920s and 1930s.
    Our friends at <%= link_to "Yehoodi", "http://yehoodi.com/" %> made a nice video history of the dance.

  What is Lindy Dojo?
</div>
<div class="post-body">
  Lindy Dojo is New School Swing's weekly practice session.
</div>
<div class="post-body">
  All students who take classes at New School Swing will be able to attend Lindy Dojo for free! Why are we doing this? Social dancing is both fun and one of the best ways to get better. So are private lessons. Many students can't afford the $25-$100 price of a private lesson, but a guided practice session is like a 5 minute private lesson. We want to encourage beginners and intermediates to stay for the practice session to practice with each other, have a good time dancing, and to work one-on-one with instructors.
